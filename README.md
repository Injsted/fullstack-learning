# Fullstack Learning Monorepo

This monorepo supports learning and experimentation with multiple programming languages and frameworks. It uses **Nx** for project and dependency management, and **pnpm** for faster and more efficient package management.

---

## **Monorepo Setup**

### **Prerequisites**

#### Install Required Tools via Homebrew
1. **Install Node.js** (Ensure version 16 or later):
   ```bash
   brew install node
   ```

2. **Install pnpm** (A fast and efficient package manager):
   ```bash
   brew install pnpm
   ```

3. **Install Nx CLI** (Globally for workspace management):
   ```bash
   brew install nx
   ```

4. (Optional) **Install Python** (for future projects):
   ```bash
   brew install python
   ```

#### Verify Installations
Run the following commands to confirm everything is set up:
```bash
node --version
pnpm --version
nx --version
python3 --version
```

---

### **Install Dependencies**
After cloning the repository, install all dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

---

### **Workspace Structure**

The monorepo is organized with projects at the root level:

```
fullstack-learning/
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend-react-js/            # React app using JavaScript
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend-react-ts/            # React app using TypeScript
â”œâ”€â”€ learning-languages/           # Multi-language learning project
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ typescript/               # TypeScript scripts and experiments
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/                  # Source code for TypeScript
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ basics/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ types.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ interfaces.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ advanced/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ generics.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ decorators.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ example.ts        # Example script
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ python/                   # Python scripts (future)
â”œâ”€â”€ backend-nodejs/               # Backend project using Node.js (future)
â”œâ”€â”€ backend-python-django/        # Backend project using Django (future)
â”œâ”€â”€ nx.json                       # Nx workspace configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json                  # Dependencies and scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ pnpm-lock.yaml                # pnpm lockfile
```

Each project is independent and configured with **Nx** targets for building, running, and testing.

## **Frontend Applications**

### **React with JavaScript (`frontend-react-js`)**
A React application built with JavaScript for learning the basics of React, including components, state, props, and lifecycle methods.

#### How to Run:
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run start:react-js
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:4200
   ```

#### Key Features:
- **JavaScript-based React**: No TypeScript, focusing on fundamental React concepts.
- **Vite Bundler**: Fast development server with instant hot module replacement.

---

### **React with TypeScript (`frontend-react-ts`)**
A React application built with TypeScript, focusing on integrating TypeScriptâ€™s static typing capabilities into React.

#### How to Run:
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run start:react-ts
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:4200
   ```

#### Key Features:
- **TypeScript-based React**: Learn React concepts with strict type checking and advanced TypeScript features.
- **Vite Bundler**: Enables fast development and optimized builds.

---

## **Learning Languages Project**

The `learning-languages` project is a dedicated space for experimenting with multiple programming languages. It currently focuses on **TypeScript**, with plans to expand to Python, Rust, and more.

### **Purpose**
- Provide a hands-on environment for practicing programming concepts.
- Experiment with language-specific features and libraries.
- Build a foundation for full-stack development by mastering multiple languages.

### **TypeScript**
The TypeScript subproject contains scripts for:
- **Basic TypeScript concepts**: Types, interfaces, and generics.
- **Advanced features**: Type inference, decorators, and utility types.
- **Real-world use cases**: Solving problems with static typing.

#### How to Run a TypeScript Script:
1. Add your `.ts` file to the `learning-languages/typescript/src/` directory:
   ```bash
   touch learning-languages/typescript/src/my-new-script.ts
   ```

2. Add your code:
   ```typescript
   // learning-languages/typescript/src/my-new-script.ts
   const greet = (name: string): string => `Hello, ${name}!`;
   console.log(greet('World'));
   ```

3. Run your script:
   ```bash
   npm run run:ts my-new-script.ts
   ```

---

### **Nx Workspace Commands**

#### List All Projects
```bash
nx list
```

#### View Dependency Graph
```bash
nx graph
```

#### Run Specific Nx Targets
```bash
nx run <project-name>:<target>
```

## **What is pnpm?**

**pnpm** is a performant and space-efficient package manager for JavaScript. It improves on npm and Yarn by creating a global package store and linking dependencies, saving disk space and speeding up installations.

### **Benefits of pnpm**
1. **Speed**: Faster installations due to optimized caching.
2. **Efficiency**: Saves disk space by creating links to a centralized package store.
3. **Strict Dependency Management**: Ensures correct resolution of dependencies.

## **Future Plans**

- Add support for Python and Rust.
- Expand the TypeScript project with real-world problem-solving examples.
- Integrate backend projects using Node.js and Django.
